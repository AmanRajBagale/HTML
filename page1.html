                      People are using internet for bad purposes like people are using internet for hacking diffent devices which are secured 
          as they can robe money and things from others devices.The modern technology has taken the human life to the different level ,higher 
          and higher.Because of technology people can store the files and information in a small device called as pendrive and can also store 
          them in folder of the computer and laptop.The internet has made our life very easier as we don't have to walk here and there to tell 
          some important things to someone,we can tell them by the help of the mobile phones and telephones.Many social links like Facebook,
          messenger,Instagram,Viber,Imo,Whatsapp and many others through which we can text and call to our friends which are not with us and 
          which are far away from us.By using internet we can also learn many things and also can study by the help of internet.We can learn 
          everything from internet and also can play online games and do many things through internet.Many people are using internet for using
          texing others and call others while some many peoples are using internet crime as to break the passwords and to hack the accounts of
          other peoples.But the best thing of the internet is that the internet has made the life of people more easier than the past and also
          helping many peoples for improving and making this life great by the help of technology.Peoples are able to communicate with others 
          through the modern technology.People are making their life and work easier through the modern technology.


                     As the internet technology has made the daily activites and life of people more easier as comparining than the past but 
        the people are becoming more lasier than lasier which is bad for their health as well as bad for them because of the internet technology.
        Mainly the childrens are affected by the internet because childrens are using internet for playing games and using facebook and they
        are addicted to the games and social apps which is bad for their studies.And using internet by the childrens for playing games and 
        more use of mobile phones the childrens are having problem of their eyes which is very bad in their age.So internet technology also had 
        bad impact for the peoples and as well was people use to watch the porn videos from the porn sites through the internet which leads them to 
        do bad things which is one of the main reason for incresing rape cases in Nepal.So, people must use internet for good purpose which will
        help them to improve their life and help people to be happy.
